            of New York City, colloquially &ldquo;the Met&ldquo;, is the largest
            art museum in the Americas. Its permanent collection contains over
            two million works, divided among 17 curatorial departments. The main
            building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern
            edge of Central Park on Manhattan&apos;s Upper East Side, is by area
            one of the world&apos;s largest art museums. A much smaller second
            location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan,
            contains an extensive collection of art, architecture, and artifacts
            from medieval Europe.

            The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 with its mission
            to bring art and art education to the American people. The
            museum&apos;s permanent collection consists of works of art from
            classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures
            from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of
            American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of
            African, Asian, Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is
            home to encyclopedic collections of musical instruments, costumes,
            and accessories, as well as antique weapons and armor from around
            the world. Several notable interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome
            through modern American design, are installed in its galleries.
